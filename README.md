# go-pwentropy
Estimates password entropy considering common passwords. Useful if you need to generate entropy for a cipher key (using
some sort of password derivation function), but want to be sure the user inputs a password with enough entropy for the
desired key size. At least, with some confidence (it is complicated, read below.).

**Long explanation and complicated answer**

Without knowing the password generation algorithm used, and taking into consideration the adversary (and his dictionary
or knowledge on how we create passwords.) the entropy calculation will not be precise but an
estimation. i.e. the entropy for the word '**hello**' can be calculated in multiple ways:

- 4 unique symbols (h e l o), length 5: 10 bits of entropy
- 26 unique symbols (lower case characters), length 5: 23.5 bits of entropy
- 250k unique symbols (english dictionary), length 1: 17.9 bits of entropy
- 25k unique symbols (common words in the english dictionary), length 1: 14.6 bits of entropy
- 2 symbols (na√Øve password generator picking one of the following words: 'hello', 'goodbye'), length 1: 1 bit of entropy

So, when we prompt the user to enter a password, and the user enters 'hello', what entropy will we estimate?
